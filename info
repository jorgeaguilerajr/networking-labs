 Networking Labs (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This repository contains a collection of hands-on labs built in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to demonstrate fundamental and intermediate networking concepts.  

Each project is documented with:
-Network topology diagrams
-Key router & switch configurations
-Verification screenshots (pings, DHCP leases, ACL counters)
-Security best practices

These labs serve as both a **personal portfolio** and a **study resource** for roles such as Network Technician, NOC Analyst, or Systems Administrator.
