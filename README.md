Hands-on Cisco Packet Tracer labs demonstrating VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, ACLs, and secure network design for portfolio and study purposes.
# Networking Labs (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This repository contains hands-on networking labs built in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
Each project demonstrates networking fundamentals and best practices, and is documented with:

- ðŸ“¡ **Topology diagrams**
- ðŸ”‘ **Key router & switch configurations**
- âœ… **Verification screenshots** (ping tests, DHCP bindings, ACL counters)
- ðŸ”’ **Security considerations**

These labs showcase practical networking skills for roles such as **Network Technician, NOC Analyst, or Systems Administrator**.
